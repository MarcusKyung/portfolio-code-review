            <p class="card-text">Hello, and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Marcus Kyung and I am an aspiring web developer currently enrolled in Epicodus' full time WebDev bootcamp. I decided to pursue web development after working in the marketing and project management field for the past 5 years at both agencies and non-profits. Though I thouroughly enjoyed my time working in marketing and project management I felt that I wanted more opportunities to create things in my professional life. Below is a brief overview of my education, professional experience, and a few personal interests/hobbies. For further inquiries please reach out by email at the button below.</p>
